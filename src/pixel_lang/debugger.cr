class Debugger < AutoEngine
  # Need to
  #  - Display instructions
  #  - Color pistons uniquely for each piston
  #  - Label cells with subscript that have more than one piston on a single instruction
  #  - Track changes
  #    - Add piston event "on_register_change"

  # This will be just a basic interface for debugging
  # I will need to write an app for actual debugging.
